## When Things Go Sideways

Even the best bots hiccup. Here's how to fix it:

### No Trades Showing

- **Problem**: WebSocket's napping.
- **Fix**: Check `trade_logs.txt` for clues. Retry with \[🔄 Retry\] or switch DEXs.

### API Errors

- **Problem**: Vybe's API is moody.
- **Fix**: Test `curl https://api.vybenetwork.xyz`. If it's down, chill and try later.

### Snark's Missing

- **Problem**: Groq API key's AWOL.
- **Fix**: Add it to `.env` or enjoy the silence.
